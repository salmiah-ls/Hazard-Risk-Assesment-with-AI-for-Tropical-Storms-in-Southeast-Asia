Southeast Asia is a region extremely vulnerable to tropical storms, locally known as typhoons. Its geographical position within the typhoon belt of the Western Pacific makes it highly susceptible to these powerful storms. Furthermore, the intensifying impacts of climate change exacerbate this vulnerability. Rising sea levels increase the risk of storm surges, while warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for storms to develop and intensify, leading to more frequent and severe events.

The region experiences numerous tropical storms annually, ranging from minor disturbances to powerful typhoons. One of the deadliest events in recent history was Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated Central Philippines in 2013. This catastrophic storm resulted in a staggering loss of life, with over 6,352 fatalities and 28,781 injuries. The economic toll was equally immense, with estimated damages exceeding USD 2.99 billion[1]. More recently, Typhoon Yagi impacted the coastal areas of Vietnam in September 2023, causing significant damage. This disaster led to the loss of 844 lives, injured 2,279 individuals, and resulted in economic losses exceeding USD 16.9 million[2].
