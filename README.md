## Hazard Risk Assesment with AI for Tropical Cyclones in Southeast Asia
### Introduction

Tropical cyclones, also known as typhoons or hurricanes, are powerful natural phenomena that can cause significant damage and loss of life in Southeast Asia. These storms are characterized by their intense winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, which can lead to flooding, landslides, and other natural disasters. As Southeast Asia is a region vulnerable to tropical cyclones, understanding and assessing the risks associated with these storms are crucial for effective disaster management and mitigation.

This prototype will delve into the topic of hazard risk assessment for tropical cyclones in Southeast Asia, examining the factors contributing to the region's vulnerability, the potential impacts of these storms, and the strategies that can be implemented to reduce the risks and enhance resilience.

For this prototype, I use 2 deadliest typhoon that ever hit Southeast Asia as case studies:
