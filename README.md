# Leveraging AI for Hazard (Typhoon) Risk Assesment in the most vulnerable countries of Southeast Asia
### Introduction

Southeast Asian countries are particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones due to their geographic location and climatic conditions. The region is situated along the Pacific Ocean, a major breeding ground for these storms. The warm ocean waters provide the energy for typhoons to form and intensify. Additionally, the region's mountainous terrain and extensive coastlines can exacerbate the impacts of these storms, leading to flooding, landslides, and coastal erosion. These factors, combined with dense populations in many areas, make Southeast Asia highly susceptible to the devastating effects of tropical cyclones.
