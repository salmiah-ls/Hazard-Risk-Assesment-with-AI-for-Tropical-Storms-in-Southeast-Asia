__Affected Areas:__
According to the UN report, three regions—Northeast, Northwest, and Red River Delta—were severely impacted by the typhoon. However, the Northwest region primarily experienced damage from monsoon-induced floods rather than direct typhoon effects. Therefore, this analysis will focus on the two regions most directly affected by the typhoon: Northeast and Red River Delta.
  * Northeast:
    1. Quảng Ninh
  * Red River Delta:
    1. Hải Phòng
